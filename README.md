# CIFAR10ImageClassification
Convolutional neural network that tries to identify 10 different types of images.
It uses 3 convolutional layers with max pooling followed by a fully connected layer. The fully connected layer
applies a non-linear function (Rectified Linear Units) as the activation function. The fully connected layer is followed by a dropout function to decrease the variance of the model.
