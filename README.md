# CIFAR10ImageClassification
Convolutional neural network that tries to identify 10 different types of pictures.
It uses 3 convolutional layers with max pooling followed by a fully connected layer. The fully connected layer
applies a non-linear function (Rectified Linear Units). The fully connected layer is followed a dropout function.

This was created as part of the Deep Learning Foundations nanodegree from Udacity
